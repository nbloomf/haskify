* Remove float for fixed point in tax fields
* complete the data schema
* implement more endpoints/tests
* generate endpoints (need more examples first)
* in monad: rate limiting, retry? (<2 requests per second)
* server for webhooks
* FromJSON for singletons should fail if extra keys are present
* "ShopifyObject" typeclass? would this be useful?
* helper function to get random/unique numbers in HaskifyM for use in testing
* don't need ToURL class
* Make HaskifyM a generic REST/HTTP client monad?
